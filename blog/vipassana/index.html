        If you're feeling unproductive during coronavirus, this option is available to you: lock yourself in your room for ten days, eat nothing but brown rice and black beans and meditate all day.

The ten day online meditation retreat I went on was as painful as you'd think, yet better than you'd expect. There was leg pain, hunger, boredom and tears, but also moments where I thought I might never feel fear or suffering again. I learned a lot about myself but this is no silver bullet to life. More like swallowing a pill the size of your fist. 
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
Throughout those ten days I wondered why the hell I decided to do this. Why cause myself the most intense frustration and torture that I had in my life? Why listen to some strange man with an uncanny mix of guru and entrepreneur tell me about my self-conditioning. Dave is the kind of person whose eye contact pierces through you even through a computer screen. It feels like he's trying to sell you something, something other than just this meditation retreat.
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
In between points of genuine peace and happiness — laughing for 30 minutes for no reason, reliving the best moments of my life — there were low points. It was a coin flip whether I'd work through the pain of sitting still for an hour to reach a peaceful state, or accomplish nothing but frying my nervous system with pain and intense emotion.
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
I was forced to experience what I hated to think about, what I deeply feared, and the feelings that made me want to punch a wall. And so I got ten days — ten cycles of watching my mind wanting to move, use my phone, eat eggs, argue about politics and give up, yet seeing myself eventually get to bed somehow unharmed. 
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
But in going through these cycles of pain I would always learn something even though it never felt that way during the process. I had gone through the hardest thing I could. I took myself to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. 
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
We all know that the tragedies and trauma of life teach us about it the most. Eventually boredom invites you to be curious, breakups teach you to appreciate, and death brings urgency. But it is nearly impossible to keep this larger cycle in view when going through our misfortunes.
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
I already knew about my constant need to be entertained, to be loved, my fear of death, the way the mole on my pinky must mean I have melanoma. But directly experiencing them in their worst form, unable to hide, and seeing them all eventually pass gave me an opportunity — a chance to view my identity differently, the necessary precursor to any change in behavior. 
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
I too often fears small social interactions like: I can not help but worry about talking to my barber or calling a stranger on the phone. Although knowing this about myself should help me overcome it, these kind of things often become self-limiting beliefs, negative habits of fear we use to protect ourselves. Do you really not like to dance or are you still too scared from that time you felt intensely uncomfortable about it in middle school?
</p><p id="writingParagraph"></p>
To change our shortcomings that we know we should change, we often need a painful moment in our life that forces us to suffer through them. In experiencing their eventual passing, we see that these worries, fear, and pain are not essential to our identity. I still worry about most of the same things, but I directly experienced how useless that worry is and how it doesn't describe me — the me in this moment — but describes my previous patterns of behavior. It describes a long line of preceding me's who I have the choice whether to identify with.
