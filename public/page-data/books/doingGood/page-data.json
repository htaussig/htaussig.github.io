If you did that, it would stay with you for the rest of your life. If you saved several people’s lives—running into a burning building one week, rescuing someone from drowning the next week, and diving in front of a bullet the week after—you’d think your life was really special. You’d be in the news. You’d be a hero. But we can do far more than that. According to the most rigorous estimates, the cost to save a life in the developing world is about $3,400\"</li>\n<li>\"Our response to natural disasters is one of the clearest cases of how, when it comes to charity, most people follow their gut and respond to new events rather than ongoing problems. When a disaster strikes, the emotional centers of our brain flare up: we think—emergency! We forget there is an emergency happening all the time, because we’ve grown accustomed to everyday emergencies like disease and poverty and oppression.\"</li>\n<li>\"First, scale. What’s the magnitude of this problem? How much does it affect lives in the short run and long run? Second, neglectedness. How many resources are already being dedicated to tackling this problem? How well allocated are the resources that are currently being dedicated to the problem? Is there reason to expect this problem can’t be solved by markets or governments? Third, tractability. How easy is it to make progress on this problem, and how easy is it to tell if you’re making progress? Do interventions within this cause exist, and how strong is the evidence behind those interventions? Do you expect to be able to discover new promising interventions within this cause?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who Should Read It?</h3>\n<p>Seriously anyone who is considering taking a certain career to do good. There are just so many well-intentioned misconceptions here, and it would be terrible for someone to want to do the most good they could in their life, but not be able to.</p>\n<p>I really think this could be one of the great movements of future decades. I would want anyone making over 100k a year to read it, because you really don't need that much money.</p>\n<p>But I think people already trying to do good would be most perceptive. It doesn't convince you to do good, but it does convince you that you could definitely be doing good better.</p>\n<h3>How the Book Changed Me</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I can do so much more good for this world than I thought I could</li>\n<li>I am ridiculously lucky to be born where I am into this family, and it is no fault of other's that they are living in extreme poverty</li>\n<li>Donating 10% of my income</li>\n<li>This is the most important thing to me outside of myself. I really want to commit to doing good in the future and am going to get involved with EA now and in the future. I hope to bring it back stronger to Haverford and to any place I work or live.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Doing Good Better","author":"Will MacAskill","rating":"9/10","date":"01 January, 2021","bookCoverImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":167,"height":256,"src":"/static/149c74853c21734868062d4079a68155/b20fd/DoingGoodBetterCover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/149c74853c21734868062d4079a68155/b20fd/DoingGoodBetterCover.jpg 1x,\n/static/149c74853c21734868062d4079a68155/c5bbe/DoingGoodBetterCover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/149c74853c21734868062d4079a68155/84240/DoingGoodBetterCover.jpg 2x"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/doingGood/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3159585216"]}
