In Chapter 2, we saw how humans (and all other species for that matter) are locked in the game of natural selection, which often rewards selfish, competitive behavior. In Chapter 3, we looked at social norms and saw how they constrain our selfish impulses, but also how norms can be fragile and hard to enforce. In Chapter 4, we looked at the many and subtle ways that humans try to cheat by exploiting the fragility of norm enforcement, largely by being discreet about bad behavior. In Chapter 5, we took a closer look at the most subtle and intriguing of all these norm-evasion techniques: self-deception. “We deceive ourselves,” as Robert Trivers says, “the better to deceive others”—in particular, to make it harder for others to catch and prosecute us for behaving badly.\"","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":4,"offset":1451},"end":{"line":14,"column":849,"offset":2296}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1448},"end":{"line":14,"column":849,"offset":2296}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\"It only demonstrates loyalty to believe something that we wouldn’t have reason to believe unless we were loyal.\"","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":4,"offset":2300},"end":{"line":15,"column":117,"offset":2413}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":2297},"end":{"line":15,"column":117,"offset":2413}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":508},"end":{"line":15,"column":117,"offset":2413}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Who Should Read It?","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":2419},"end":{"line":17,"column":24,"offset":2438}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":2415},"end":{"line":17,"column":24,"offset":2438}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you have already read some about our own systematic biases (","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":2440},"end":{"line":19,"column":64,"offset":2503}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thinking Fast and Slow, The Undoing Project","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":65,"offset":2504},"end":{"line":19,"column":108,"offset":2547}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":64,"offset":2503},"end":{"line":19,"column":109,"offset":2548}}},{"type":"text","value":") and want to know more about how these biases play out in modern areas of life such as politics, religion, and healthcare.","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":109,"offset":2548},"end":{"line":19,"column":232,"offset":2671}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":2440},"end":{"line":19,"column":232,"offset":2671}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I think this is not the best intro to our own systematic biases and would recommend this more as a supplement or if you were only interested in the effects of our biases in every day life.","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1,"offset":2673},"end":{"line":21,"column":189,"offset":2861}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1,"offset":2673},"end":{"line":21,"column":189,"offset":2861}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How the Book Changed Me","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":5,"offset":2867},"end":{"line":23,"column":28,"offset":2890}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1,"offset":2863},"end":{"line":23,"column":28,"offset":2890}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you really consider it, it is pretty easy to see anyone's motives as personally motivated.
