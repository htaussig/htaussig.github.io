The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.</li>\n<li>It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the futureâ€”sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.</li>\n<li>\"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How the Book Changed me</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More convinced of optimistic nihilism, and no longer afraid of questions regarding the meaning or meaninglessness of life, which before seemed completely unanswerable. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impressions:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick read, science wasn't too convincing, but pragmatically I think the big ideas apply, although the smaller ideas were often shallow and not super clearly conveyed (using just one example as a proof)</li>\n</ul>"}
