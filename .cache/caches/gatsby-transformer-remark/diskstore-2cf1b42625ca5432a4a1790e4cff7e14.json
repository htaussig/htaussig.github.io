Why isn’t it equally obvious that an ignorant and isolated people might undermine their psychological well-being or that their social institutions could become engines of pointless cruelty, despair, and superstition?\"</p>\n<p>\"A quotation from the anthropologist Donald Symons that captures the problem of multiculturalism especially well: If only one person in the world held down a terrified, struggling, screaming little girl, cut off her genitals with a septic blade, and sewed her back up, leaving only a tiny hole for urine and menstrual flow, the only question would be how severely that person should be punished, and whether the death penalty would be a sufficiently severe sanction. But when millions of people do this, instead of the enormity being magnified millions-fold, suddenly it becomes “culture,” and thereby magically becomes less, rather than more, horrible, and is even defended by some Western “moral thinkers,” including feminists.\"</p>\n<p>\"Again, the concept of “health” is looser still: it, too, must be defined with reference to specific goals—not suffering chronic pain, not always vomiting, etc.—and these goals are continually changing. Our notion of “health” may one day be defined by goals that we cannot currently entertain with a straight face (like the goal of spontaneously regenerating a lost limb). Does this mean we can’t study health scientifically?\"</p>\n<h3>Who Should Read It?</h3>\n<p>If you like to have your mind changed and think that morality can't be objective or think that religion is necessary for morality.</p>\n<p>If you want a deeper and clearer understanding of our moral illusions.</p>\n<h3>How the Book Changed Me</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely changed my thoughts on cultural relativism. We know that honor killings and human sacrifice do not improve the well-being of humans, and we are causing suffering by being \"tolerant\" of these (and other) explicitly terrible cultural norms.</li>\n<li>I felt before as if I had had inklings to these ideas, never sure of the idea whether morality could be objective, but this just brought extremely clear thinking to the subject, that makes me confident in contradicting my earlier mistakes</li>\n<li>If you can be confident that one way to go about things is morally superior to another, there is the basis there for encouraging another group or nation to change their practices.</li>\n<li>Reinforced the idea that morality should work independent of who you are. Basically that those born in less fortunate situations were simply less fortunate than me, us both deserving of our situations in no way</li>\n<li>Clarifying the positive moral implications of breaking the illusion of free will and so trying to see even the criminal as a victim of his own genes, circumstances, and environment. If I had the same genes, circumstances and environment, could I really have acted differently?</li>\n</ul>"}
