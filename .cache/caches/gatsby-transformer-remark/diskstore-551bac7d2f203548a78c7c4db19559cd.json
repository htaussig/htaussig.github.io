But still pretty interesting.</p>\n<h3>The Book in 3 Sentences</h3>\n<p>We have evolved to deceive ourselves of our uglier motives so that we can better deceive others.\nEven our altruistic acts are often partially motivated by signaling our status and benefit to others as a friend, mate, or ally.\nIt's important to recognize our underlying motives if we want to make real change in the world and give people the things they really want.</p>\n<h3>My Top Quotes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\"And from the point of view of a perfectly selfish organism, this extra “good” behavior is an unfortunate cost. The ideal situation would be for the brain to be able to have its cake (convincing others that it fears God’s wrath) and eat it too (go on behaving as if it didn’t fear God at all). But human brains aren’t powerful enough to pull off such perfect hypocrisy, especially when others are constantly probing our beliefs. So the next best thing is often to internalize the belief, while remaining inconsistent enough to occasionally give in to temptation.\"</li>\n<li>\"But the conclusion from the past 40 years of social psychology is that the self acts less like an autocrat and more like a press secretary. In many ways, its job—our job—isn’t to make decisions, but simply to defend them. “You are not the king of your brain,” says Steven Kaas. “You are the creepy guy standing next to the king going, ‘A most judicious choice, sire.’\"</li>\n<li>\"Let’s briefly take stock of the argument we’ve been making so far. In Chapter 2, we saw how humans (and all other species for that matter) are locked in the game of natural selection, which often rewards selfish, competitive behavior. In Chapter 3, we looked at social norms and saw how they constrain our selfish impulses, but also how norms can be fragile and hard to enforce. In Chapter 4, we looked at the many and subtle ways that humans try to cheat by exploiting the fragility of norm enforcement, largely by being discreet about bad behavior. In Chapter 5, we took a closer look at the most subtle and intriguing of all these norm-evasion techniques: self-deception. “We deceive ourselves,” as Robert Trivers says, “the better to deceive others”—in particular, to make it harder for others to catch and prosecute us for behaving badly.\"</li>\n<li>\"It only demonstrates loyalty to believe something that we wouldn’t have reason to believe unless we were loyal.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Who Should Read It?</h3>\n<p>If you have already read some about our own systematic biases (<em>Thinking Fast and Slow, The Undoing Project</em>) and want to know more about how these biases play out in modern areas of life such as politics, religion, and healthcare.</p>\n<p>I think this is not the best intro to our own systematic biases and would recommend this more as a supplement or if you were only interested in the effects of our biases in every day life.</p>\n<h3>How the Book Changed Me</h3>\n<p>If you really consider it, it is pretty easy to see anyone's motives as personally motivated. He's just writing that book for the status, or he is only donating millions to charity to look good. But most of the value here comes for applying this thinking to yourself, which is much harder. Why am I going to college, why do I want to become a software engineer, or write a book. It is worth questioning these things and the extent to which they are attached to chasing status and the extent to which I actually think I will enjoy doing them.</p>"}
