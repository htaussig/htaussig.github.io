### The Book in 3 Sentences

Being rational is a way to make our beliefs about the world more true, which matters so that we can better influence things in the ways we see fit.

We know about many of our biases, but this is not enough to overcome them, and we must be attentive and actively try to spot our biases in the moment or we will fall for them.

There are many ways we convince ourselves that we know more than we do, and we must repeatedly ask ourselves what the evidence is behind our believes, and what outcomes our beliefs predict in the real world.

### My Top 3 Quotes

1. "In the ancestral environment, anyone who says something with no obvious support is a liar or an idiot. You're not likely to think, "Hey, maybe this person has well-supported background knowledge that no one in my band has even heard of"
2. "If you don't have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything at all?"
3. "If you can explain all outcomes equally well, then your belief doesn't actually tell you anything."

### Impressions

Very clear. Very clever. Dangerously clever in making yourself feel like you've overcome all the biases just by reading about them and the "stupid" people who fell for them. But the whole point is to not fall into those kinds of traps, since we all feel that we are probably less biased than others.

### Who Should Read It?

Anyone serious about writing, learning, or making a genuine impact on the world. True beliefs are essential to making a difference, as they are what we base our actions off of (unless we are choosing randomly) and we need to build active mental habits to help us be rational because we are certainly not by default.

### How the Book Changed Me

Recognition that just knowing about my biases is not enough to defeat them.

Another layer of disillusion in the ways I deceive myself, and a better understanding of where I am likely to do so in the future.

An appreciation for how hard and how much presence of mind it takes to begin to overcome these biases

Finally a genuine grasp of bayesian reasoning
