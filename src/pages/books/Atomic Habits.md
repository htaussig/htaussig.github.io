### The Book in 3 Sentences

To start a new habit, start as easy as possible to create a foundation to build off of. 

Your habits matter because who you become and what accomplish will be a result of the collective exponential impact of what you do every day. 

Changing your environment and identity to make your habits easier is more effective than trying to summon willpower and motivation.


### My Top 3 Quotes:

"Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become"

"Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results. "

"Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. " 


### Who Should Read it?

- If you've ever thought, hmm I like the idea of reading a self-help book but thinking about the kind of person who would write one makes me want to throw up.

### How the Book Changed me

- Realizing that everything I want to accomplish in life basically has to be turned into a habit
- Better appreciation for long-term exponential growth related to myself instead of just money
- Feel like I really don't need to read any more self improvement books because this really sums it up pretty well. I've always wondered how so many people could have so many different "secrets" to well-being/success/whatever, but I think habits is the core underlying principle of whatever that "secret" is going to be. 


### Impressions:
So good, just so much better and more useful than most self-help books. 

The right amount of switching between narrative, science, common sense and deep thoughts.
